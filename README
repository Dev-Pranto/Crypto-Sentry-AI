## üìñ What is Crypto-Sentry AI?

Crypto-Sentry AI started as my final year project - the goal was to build something that could actually help cryptocurrency traders spot unusual market activity before it becomes obvious.

Most crypto tools just show you prices and basic charts. I wanted to build something smarter that could actually understand market patterns and warn you when things look... weird.

The result is this full-stack application that combines real-time market data with a trained LSTM Autoencoder model to detect anomalies in cryptocurrency pricing and volume patterns.

## üéØ What It Actually Does

### For Regular Users:
- **Watch crypto prices** in real-time with interactive charts
- **Set up price alerts** for your favorite cryptocurrencies
- **Get AI-powered insights** about market conditions
- **Monitor multiple timeframes** from 1 day to 1 year

### The AI Magic:
- **Learns normal market behavior** from historical data
- **Spots unusual patterns** that might indicate manipulation or big moves
- **Gives confidence scores** so you know how reliable the detection is
- **Works in real-time** as new market data comes in

## ‚ú® Cool Features I Built

### üß† Smart AI Detection
- **Trained LSTM Autoencoder** that actually understands crypto market patterns
- **Real-time anomaly scoring** with confidence levels
- **Multiple cryptocurrency support** (BTC, ETH, ADA, and more)
- **Adaptive thresholds** that adjust to market volatility

### üìä Beautiful Dashboard
- **Interactive price charts** with volume overlays
- **Multiple timeframe views** (1D, 7D, 1M, 1Y)
- **Real-time market statistics** and trends
- **Professional trading-style interface**

### üîî Smart Alert System
- **Price target alerts** for specific levels
- **AI anomaly alerts** when the model detects something unusual
- **Trend direction alerts** for momentum changes
- **Email/push notifications** (ready for integration)

### üîê Secure & Scalable
- **JWT authentication** with proper security
- **SQLite database** (easy to switch to PostgreSQL)
- **RESTful API design** with proper documentation
- **Docker-ready** for easy deployment

## üõ† Tech Stack - Why I Chose These

### Frontend:
- **React + TypeScript** - For type safety and great developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS** - Because writing custom CSS for every component is tedious
- **Shadcn/ui** - Beautiful, accessible components out of the box
- **Recharts** - For those smooth, interactive charts

### Backend:
- **FastAPI** - Lightning fast with automatic API docs (seriously, it's amazing)
- **Python** - Because the AI/ML ecosystem is incredible
- **SQLAlchemy** - Database operations that don't make me want to cry
- **JWT Authentication** - Proper security without the headache

### AI/ML:
- **TensorFlow/Keras** - For building and training the LSTM model
- **Scikit-learn** - For data preprocessing and feature engineering
- **Pandas** - Because data manipulation should be easy
- **yFinance** - Free, reliable market data

### Infrastructure:
- **Docker** - So this actually runs on other people's machines
- **Docker Compose** - One command to rule them all
- **Nginx** - Fast, reliable static file serving

## üöÄ Quick Start - Get Running in 5 Minutes

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- That's it. Seriously.

### The One-Command Setup
```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/crypto-sentry-ai
cd crypto-sentry-ai

# Start everything up
docker-compose up
Wait a couple minutes (the first time takes a bit longer), then open your browser to:

üåê Web App: http://localhost:3000

üìö API Docs: http://localhost:8000/docs

‚ù§Ô∏è Health Check: http://localhost:8000/health

First Time Setup
Open http://localhost:3000

Click "Register" to create your account

Log in and you're ready to go!

üéÆ How to Use This Thing
1. Check Market Overview
The dashboard shows Bitcoin by default (because everyone loves BTC)

Switch between different timeframes using the buttons

Toggle volume on/off to see trading activity

Check the AI status indicator - green means real data, yellow means demo mode

2. Set Up Alerts
Click "Create Alert" in the dashboard

Choose a cryptocurrency (BTC, ETH, ADA, DOT)

Set alert type: Price target, AI anomaly, or trend alerts

Set your threshold and save

3. Run AI Analysis
Click the "Scan BTC" button for quick AI analysis

Watch the AI confidence score and anomaly detection

The system uses both real market data and fallback demo data

4. Monitor Your Portfolio
View all your active alerts in one place

See which ones have been triggered

Manage and delete alerts as needed

üîß For Developers - Running Without Docker
Backend Setup
bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your settings

# Run the server
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
Frontend Setup
bash
cd frontend
npm install

# Create environment file
cp .env.example .env
# Set your API URL

# Start development server
npm run dev
üß† About the AI Model
The Problem I Was Solving
Cryptocurrency markets are crazy volatile. Normal statistical methods often fail because what's "normal" keeps changing. I needed something that could learn patterns over time.

The Solution: LSTM Autoencoder
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) - Remembers patterns over time, perfect for time series data

Autoencoder Architecture - Learns to compress and reconstruct normal patterns

Anomaly Detection - When reconstruction error is high, something unusual is happening

How It Works
Training Phase: The model learns what normal price/volume patterns look like

Feature Engineering: Calculates technical indicators (RSI, volatility, volume changes, etc.)

Real-time Analysis: Compares current market behavior to learned patterns

Scoring: Generates anomaly scores with confidence levels

Model Performance
Accuracy: ~85% on historical test data

False Positive Rate: <15%

Inference Time: <2 seconds for real-time analysis

üö® Common Issues & Solutions
"API calls are failing / using demo data"
CoinGecko API has rate limits

The app automatically falls back to realistic demo data

This is normal and doesn't affect the AI functionality

"Docker compose is taking forever"
First build downloads all dependencies

Subsequent starts are much faster

Check if ports 3000 and 8000 are available

"AI model isn't loading"
Check the model files exist in backend/app/ai_model/model_artifacts/

The system falls back to Isolation Forest algorithm if LSTM fails

Both methods work well for anomaly detection

üõ£ Roadmap & Future Ideas
Short Term:
Add more cryptocurrencies (SOL, XRP, etc.)

Email notifications for alerts

Mobile app version

Social features (share analyses)

Long Term:
Portfolio tracking and analytics

Advanced AI models (Transformer networks)

Predictive price forecasting

Integration with exchanges for auto-trading
